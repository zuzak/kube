# Claude Code guide for this repo

This is a GitOps repository for a personal two-node k3s cluster managed by Argo CD.

## Cluster layout

| Node | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `saraneth` | VPS (Bitfolk), amd64, 4GB RAM | Edge/ingress node; runs non-k8s services (PostgreSQL, Node.js, Tailscale) alongside k3s |
| `pi.home.arpa` | Raspberry Pi 5, arm64, 8GB RAM | Primary workload node |

Nodes are connected via Tailscale. The k3s datastore is PostgreSQL on `saraneth`.

## Making changes

All application configuration goes through Argo CD. Push to `main` and Argo CD
will sync automatically. To apply immediately, trigger a sync in the Argo CD UI.

When adding helm values to an Application manifest, place them under
`spec.source.helm.values`.

Always update the README with a high-level description of the cluster state.
The target audience is passers-by who are unfamilliar with the cluster itself,
but it should contain enough information for a systems administrator to recreate
the configuration on a node from scratch.

## Pre-commit hooks

The repo uses pre-commit hooks (`k8svalidate`, `check-yaml`, whitespace fixes).
These run automatically on commit. To run manually: `pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Applying node-level changes

Changes to node taints or kubelet config on `saraneth` must be applied manually
via `ssh z` — they are not managed by Argo CD.

## Outstanding work

- Debug Tailscale MagicDNS on the Pi (currently disabled)
